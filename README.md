[Notabase](https://notabase.io) is a personal knowledge base for networked thinking.

It lets you connect knowledge and form ideas by linking notes together. These links allow you to traverse your notes like webpages and find connections that you never would have thought of otherwise. Think of it as a personal Wikipedia for your brain that you can edit and browse as you like. As you add more notes, it gets more powerful!

It is inspired by note-taking apps such as Notion, Obsidian, Typora, and Roam Research.

## Self-hosting / running locally

Notabase is currently focused on the hosted experience, but it is possible for you to self-host it as well. Here are some steps that you need to take to get it running locally:

1. Notabase uses Supabase as the backend (for authentication, database, and storage), so you'll have to make a [Supabase](https://supabase.io) account. If you prefer to self-host Supabase, you can follow the instructions in their [docs](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/self-hosting).
2. Copy `.env.local.example` into `.env.local` and fill in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` variables from your [Supabase dashboard](https://app.supabase.io). The other environment variables are optional.
3. Create your database tables. Apply [full schema](https://github.com/churichard/notabase/blob/main/scripts/schema.sql) and [storage setup](https://github.com/churichard/notabase/blob/main/scripts/storage-setup.sql).
4. In your local environment, install the packages using `npm install`, and then build and run the project using `npm run build` and `npm start`. Alternatively, for a development environment, run `npm run dev`.

Note: the hosted and self-hosted versions of Notabase share the same codebase, so by default, there is a cap on the number of notes you can create. You can circumvent this by inserting a new row in the `subscriptions` table for your user id, with `pro` in the `plan_id` column and `active` in the `subscription_status` column.

## Testing

### Unit tests

You can run unit tests by running `npm run test`.

### Cypress tests

First-time setup:

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose.
2. Installed the supabase-cli: `npm i -g supabase`.
3. Run `supabase init` to initialize your Supabase project.
4. Copy `.env.test.example` into `.env.test` and fill in the environment variables.

To run tests:

1. Start Docker.
2. Run `supabase start`.
3. Run `NODE_ENV=test npm run dev`.
4. Run `npm run cy:open` to run Cypress tests in a GUI, or `npm run cy:run` to run them in the CLI.
