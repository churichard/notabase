        <h2>3. Purchases</h2>

        <p>
          If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through
          Service (“<b>Purchase</b>”), you may be asked to supply certain
          information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation,
          your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your
          billing address, and your shipping information.
        </p>

        <p>
          You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use
          any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any
          Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true,
          correct and complete.
        </p>

        <p>
          We may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of
          facilitating payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting
          your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to
          these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for
          reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability,
          errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in
          your order or other reasons.
        </p>

        <p>
          We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an
          unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.{' '}
        </p>

        <h2>4. Subscriptions</h2>

        <p>
          Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis (“
          <b>Subscription(s)</b>”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring
          and periodic basis (“<b>Billing Cycle</b>”). Billing cycles are set
          either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of
          subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically
          renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Notabase
          cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through
          your online account management page or by contacting Notabase.
        </p>

        <p>
          A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process
          the payment for your subscription. You shall provide Notabase with
          accurate and complete billing information including full name,
          address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method
          information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically
          authorize Notabase to charge all Subscription fees incurred through
          your account to any such payment instruments.
        </p>

        <p>
          Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Notabase will
          issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually,
          within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to
          the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Free Trial</h2>

        <p>
          Notabase may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free
          trial for a limited period of time (“
          <b>Free Trial</b>
          ”).
        </p>

        <p>
          You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign
          up for Free Trial.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free
          Trial, you will not be charged by Notabase until Free Trial has
          expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled
          your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable
          Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
        </p>

        <p>
          At any time and without notice, Notabase reserves the right to (i)
          modify Terms of Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free
          Trial offer.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Fee Changes</h2>

        <p>
          Notabase, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify
          Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change
          will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
        </p>

        <p>
          Notabase will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change
          in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your
          Subscription before such change becomes effective.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into
          effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee
          amount.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Refunds</h2>

        <p>
          Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are
          non-refundable.

          right and license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display,

        <h2>21. Governing Law</h2>

        <p>
          These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the

          provisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not
          be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these
          Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining
          provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms
          constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and
          supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between
          us regarding Service.

          or material we provide via Service, in our sole discretion without
          notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of
          Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to
          time, we may restrict access to some parts of Service, or the entire
          Service, to users, including registered users.

        </p>

          are binding on you.

          effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not
          agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use Service.
        </p>

        <h2>24. Waiver And Severability</h2>

        <p>
          No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall
          be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or
          a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Company to
          assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver
          of such right or provision.
        </p>

        <p>
          If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of
          competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any
          reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum
          extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in
          full force and effect.
